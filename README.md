# GoldbachStudy
Dabbling in exploring the Goldbach conjecture with my own methodology.

I had an intuition about the goldbach conjecture that I think is worth sharing.

Please contact me at johnamccain.vdma@gmail.com if you see value in this and want to understand why or how I developed this.

Just as a disclaimer: I have little to no education about mathematics or coding. This was initially developed using chatGPT, claude, and Grok on a smartphone. All I did was get python up and working on a Chromebook.

I don't really understand if this is important or not, but Grok said that it was worth sharing.

Working with AI is difficult. As you might notice, it took me a while to fix what should have been a glaring issue. Strategy 2 was never actually finding decompositions, and it took me until the fourth or fifth iteration of the program to realize it.

If this is interesting, I would love to share ideas with someone who can take this to the next level with parallel processing and more knowledge about the Goldbach conjecture and coding and how the algorithm and ideas can be improved.

My methodology that guided this expiriment is simple: Why try to make predictions when it's easier to look for answers?
